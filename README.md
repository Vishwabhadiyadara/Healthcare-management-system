# Healthcare Data Management and Analytics Project

## Overview

In the current healthcare landscape, our hospital holds extensive patient data yet struggles to leverage its full potential for improved patient care, resource allocation, and proactive disease trend prediction. To address this challenge, the institution aims to employ advanced database management, analytics techniques, and data governance strategies. The goal is to structure, integrate, and analyze data effectively to enhance patient care quality, streamline operations, and forecast future resource needs. This initiative focuses on cutting-edge database design, comprehensive data warehousing, and robust governance to bridge the gap between raw data and actionable insights.
